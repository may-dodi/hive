 * hand-mirrored copy would let T5 keep passing while the real posted text
 * drifted away from it — the exact drift the strip exists to prevent.
 *
 * ⚠ WORDING IS LOAD-BEARING, NOT COSMETIC (spec §5.3). The ack must be true at
 * every instant it can fire, including one that is easy to miss: the
 * per-thread lock spin-waits BEFORE the breaker permit is acquired
 * (agent-manager.ts), so an acked turn may be queued behind a sibling on the
 * same `agentId:threadId` rather than generating anything. Any wording
 * asserting work is happening RIGHT NOW ("looking into this", "working on
 * it") is false in that window. "Picked this up" claims only assignment,
 * which is true from selection through the lock wait, the breaker acquire and
 * the model call alike. It is a statement of STATE, not a promise of a reply
 * — which is what makes the "an ack is never retracted" rule (§6.4) liveable.
 * A bare "On it." is equally honest but was rejected on collision surface: a
 * whole agent reply of exactly "On it." is plausible in a conference thread,
 * while the two-clause sentence is not.
 *
 * Verified byte-identical round-trip through markdownToMrkdwn

    // resolution (targetAgentId routes it through resolveAgents step 0,

    // non-conference turn as a conference turn with an injection mode it
    // never used — corrupting both C18 measurement surfaces
    // (agent_turn_telemetry, activity_log). Same shape as C26's `worker:`

   *   2. the delta arm (formatDeltaContext),
   *   3. the meetingLastSeenTs high-water calc  — all three via buildConferenceContext,
   *   4. the round-0 classifier's `history.slice(-5)` recency window,
   *   5. the meeting scribe's noteActivity (novelty count + summary prompt).
   *
   * ⚠ DELIBERATELY NOT GATED ON `meetingAckEnabled`: flipping the lever off
   * must not un-hide acks that are already sitting in a live thread (spec
   * §5.5 / §10 — the rollback is clean at both ends). Pinned by the
   * `ackEnabled: false` row of T5.
   *
   * ⚠ ANY NEW MEETING-HISTORY READ MUST COME THROUGH HERE. A direct
   * slackAdapter call would silently re-expose acks to that consumer. Pinned
   * structurally by T13(a).
   *
   * The strip lives here rather than in SlackAdapter because "is this an ack"
   * is a MEETING-domain fact; the channel-domain adapter should keep returning
   * what Slack actually has (an agent reading the channel with its own `slack`
   * MCP tools sees the acks verbatim, and that is expected — spec §8).
   *
   * Exact factoring, not a behavior change for non-ack messages: both former
   * call sites computed this identical channelId/threadTs pair, and the
   * no-slackAdapter branch returns [] exactly as the old `let history = []`
   * initialization did.
